These are self challenging projects

Challenge1: Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
This code uses a for loop to iterate over all the numbers from 0 to 10, and then uses an if statement to check if each number is even. If the number is even, it is printed to the console using the console.log() function. The % operator is used to check if a number is even or odd by checking if it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.

Number 2:  Print a table containing multiplication tables
 This code uses two nested for loops to iterate over all the rows and columns of the table. The outer loop iterates over each row, while the inner loop iterates over each column. The value of each cell is calculated by multiplying the row number (i) by the column number (j). The resulting value is added to a string variable (row) that holds the entire row of the table. The "\t" character is used to separate each cell by a tab.

After each row is complete, the console.log() function is used to print the entire row to the console. This process is repeated for each row, resulting in a complete multiplication table from 1 through 10 being printed to the console.
